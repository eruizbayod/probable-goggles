GIT REP

This git folder contains different folders for the weekly tasks of the unit and a folder called GAME containing all the files needed for the game launch and the python file that runs the game.

2 PLAYER GAME

On the GAME/Game.py we can see all the code needed for the game. Some setting can be edited on the code to change the experience of how the game is played:

-	WIDTH and HEIGHT, to change the size of the window. Not recommended to change.
-	SPACESHIP SPEED: adjust to change the speed of how fast players move around the map.
-	BULLETS_SPEED: to define how fast the bullets are moving.
-	FPS: define how many frames per second we want the screen to refresh.
-	SPACESHIP_WIDTH and HEIGHT: to increase or decrease the spaceships sizes.
-	MAX_NUM_BULLETS: defines the maximum number of bullets that each player can spam on the window.
-	
On GAME/Assets are located the files that are used in the game, more can be added if we want to give different images for the spaceships or have different backgrounds. Also different sound effects can be added to create a different game experience.

HOW TO PLAY
